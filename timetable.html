        Smaller informal evening at Jesus College.<br />
        This is a relaxed evening with a few less people. If you are invited, we’d love you to feel free to join in with
        as much or as little as you would like. The service and lunchtime reception are the main parts of the day, so
        it’s fine if you need to head home early or have other things to do.<br />
        Children of all ages are very welcome to stay, if it is a little too late for some then we would love to
        contribute towards any babysitting costs. Contact <a
