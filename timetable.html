        Informal evening at Jesus College soft start.<br />
        We hope it is a relaxed evening where people can join in with as much or as little as they would like, we know
        some might need to start heading home and it might be a little too much for some younger children (or adults of
        any age) so don’t feel like you must stay for this. The service and lunchtime reception are the main parts of
        the day.<br />
        Children of all ages are very welcome to stay, if it is a little too late for some then we would love to
        contribute towards any babysitting costs.<br />
        Due to being inside this part of the day is more limited on numbers and most likely to affected by any covid
        restrictions.<br />
