<p>The theme of our wedding is <strong>joy</strong>, so please forgive us as we <strong>joyfully</strong> overuse the
  word in this intro.</p>

<p>It is a <strong>joy</strong> that you have received the invitation and have found the website! Hopefully you will
  find what you need
  here so you can en<strong>joy</strong> the day as much as possible. </p>

<p>Please fill in the form on the RSVP so that we have the <strong>joy</strong> of knowing you can come or if you can’t
  the <strong>joy</strong> of
  looking forward to hopefully seeing you another time. </p>

<p>If you can’t make it is still useful to let us have your email address so we can send you the livestream link, it is
  a <strong>joy</strong> that technology means that hopefully anywhere in the world people can tune in.</p>

<p>There is a gift list, but the <strong>joy</strong> is in having you as friends, family and loved ones so please feel
  no need to get us
  anything. If it would be useful for you to have a bit of help with travel, babysitting or accommodation costs then do
  let us know, it would be a <strong>joy</strong> to help. </p>

<p>If you have any questions or we have missed something useful please email <a
    href="mailto:wedding@kinton.org">wedding@kinton.org</a> and we will <strong>joy</strong>fully respond.
</p>

<p>Matthew and Sarah</p>
