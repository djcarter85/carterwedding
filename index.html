<p>The theme of our wedding is <strong>joy</strong>!</p>
<p>
  It is a joy that you have received the invitation and have reached our website. You should find all you need here so
  you can enjoy the day as much as possible.
</p>
<p>Please fill in the <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP form</a> so that we have the joy of knowing whether you can come. If you
  can’t make it, please
  fill in your email address so we can send you the livestream link. It is a joy that technology means you can tune in
  from anywhere.
</p>
<p>If it would bring you joy to give us a gift, we have made a <a href="gift-list.html">gift list</a>. However, our joy
  is in having you as our
  friends and family.
</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to ask if you would like a bit of help with travel, babysitting or accommodation costs. It
  would be a joy to help.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions or we have missed something useful, please email <a
    href="mailto:wedding@kinton.org">wedding@kinton.org</a> and we will joyfully
  respond!
</p>
<p>Love,
