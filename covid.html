<p>
  We are thankful that easing of restrictions means we are able to welcome everyone to our wedding. However, we are
  aware that Covid-19 has not gone away and we would like everyone to feel safe and able to enjoy the day. We will set
  out below some of the measures we are taking and a few things we are asking of you. Some of these will be voluntary
  and there may be good individual reasons not to follow some of them. However, out of love for others, we earnestly ask
  that you might give up some of the new freedoms we have for the sake of others.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>We are asking if everyone attending the wedding could please carry out a lateral flow test before
      coming.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Please bring a mask with you</strong>, and wear it if asked to do so. We strongly encourage people to wear a
    mask inside, including during the ceremony and when moving around inside Jesus College. We are hoping to sing but it
    is likely this will be with masks on.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will be <strong>outside</strong> as much as possible, this includes the lunchtime reception and ceilidh, although
    the evening meal will be in a well ventilated large room, with space to spread out. There will be three marquees
    with open sides so while some of the wet weather options will be inside there will always be an outside one as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Please respect social distancing</strong>, and be considerate that people may feel differently about
    distancing. We know within friends and family groups people may choose to not distance, but the assumption is that
    people will distance unless mutually agreed otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the ceremony we strongly encourage households to sit distanced from each other, it is a large building. On top of
    that, there will be <strong>options for maintaining a slightly greater distance</strong>. Including an area with
    enforced spaces and no singing. Please let us know if you would like to sit socially distanced for the ceremony or
    evening meal. Throughout the day we hope to always have options to distance more available.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ceilidh is very optional. It will be outside, with plenty of space and might at times look a little different to
    normal. It should still be fun to be a part of or watch.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plenty of hand sanitiser will be available.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are any other measures that you would like us to consider, <strong>please get in contact</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
