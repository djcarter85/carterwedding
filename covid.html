  While we are optimistic that the wedding can go ahead as planned, we cannot be certain that there wonâ€™t be
  restrictions in place. We have invited on the hope of no number restrictions; if this is not the case we know you will
  understand not everyone will be able to come. We will keep you updated, so please check your emails and this page for
  more information.
</p>

<p>
  We will be live streaming the service either way and we really want to make sure that everyone is comfortable and
  feels safe. It might be that others are making different decisions to you, so please be respectful. If we can do
  things to make you feel safer on the day, please let us know.
</p>

<p>
  If you pray, then please pray that the wedding would be safe and that the joy of our marriage, and the future it is
  pointing to, would ring out, whatever the circumstances.
