  While we are optimistic that the wedding can go ahead as planned, we cannot be certain of that. It might be that
  numbers are restricted, either because of the rules or to be able to keep social distancing. Plans might have to be
  adapted and the government might ask us to do things like lateral flow tests before hand as well. We will keep you
  updated when we know more, so please check your emails nearer the time and this page for more information.
</p>

<p>
  We will be live streaming the service either way and we really want to make sure that everyone is comfortable and
  feels safe. It might be that others are making different decisions on distancing to you, so please respect that. If we
  can do things to make you feel safer on the day, please do say.
</p>
<p>
  If you pray, then please pray that the wedding would be safe and that the joy of the marriage and the future it is
  pointing to would ring out whatever we are allowed.
