<h1>Gift List</h1>

<p>
  We are not expecting presents, but if it would bring you joy to give us a gift, <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bYfvGtKYjtI2yuF9gvR2kP0VuR7kzVtgFfogfu6JPqI/edit?usp=sharing">we’ve
    created a gift list of things
    we’d find useful</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Please have gifts delivered to <em>58 Abbey Road, Cambridge, CB5 8HQ</em>, or bring them to the lunchtime reception at
  Jesus
  College. Do label your presents with your name so that we can thank you properly!
</p>

<p>
  Instead, as a gift to us, you may like to give money to a charity. We would love it if you did this!
  We would particularly like to support <em>Mencap</em> and <em>Save the Children</em>, in memory of Matthew’s aunts.

  Aunty Evelyn was so often the definition of joy. She was a huge personality, loving, competitive and a lot of fun. She
  was often off on one adventure or another. Aunt Evelyn benefited from the work of Mencap and we would like to support
  those, including those who have Down's Syndrome like her, who bring so much joy to this world. <a

    here</a>.

  Aunty Sarah was hugely intelligent and you ended up learning things by just being around her. She had so much time and
  patience for her nieces and nephews, always thinking of fun games to play and activities to do. She was hugely caring
  and we think that Save the Children is a charity that stands for many of the things, especially education, that she
  did. <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/kinton-wedding-savethechildren">You can give to Save the Children
